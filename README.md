🎯 Built a Quiz Game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript! 💻✨

I recently built a Quiz Game as a hands-on project to improve my front-end development skills.

🔹 Features included:
✅ Start, Quiz & Result screens
✅ Dynamic questions and answers
✅ Progress bar for better UX
✅ Clean UI with background image
✅ Fully responsive design

This project helped me understand:
👉 DOM manipulation
👉 Event handling in JavaScript
👉 UI/UX basics
👉 How logic + design work together

Small projects like this are a great way to learn by doing and strengthen core web development concepts.

📌 Next step: Adding timer, more question categories & animations.
